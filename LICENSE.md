### Attribution Requirement:

Any modified versions of this Software must include attribution to the original

### Object DOM Pattern:

The Object DOM pattern introduced by this framework is Resti Guay's contribution
to the web development community:

```js
{ div: { className: 'class', children: [...] } }
{ h1: { text: 'content' } }
{ TodoInput: {} } // Custom components
```

While the Object DOM pattern itself is freely available for use in any project,
attribution to Resti Guay as the creator of this pattern is appreciated when
implementing similar object-literal DOM representations.
